        <h4>This application allows me and my family to schedule tasks as well as see whole family members' schedules at once.
            Date specific todo items related to each member appear on today's date, so that on the right day those cards will 
            remind the member what agenda he has. Then once it's complete, the card can be removed to create a sense of achievement!
            Aside from the main scheduling tool, a lot of informative APIs such as Weather, News, Covid etc to make 
            this application more fun.
            This project integrated my newly obtained skill, Javascript, into Django, which is used in clock, baloons, 
            and greeting in the navbar. Along the way, also SCSS is used. Please use test credentials (username:testuser, password test123456).

        <h4>As a capstone project for Flask Web Development course in CodingNomads, 
            I was excited to be able to fully integrate most of the topics I learned 
            in addition to some new extensions, libraries and technologies such as AWS S3 bucket 
            and search module etc. Whilst it was tough going, this project has given me 
            more confidence in knowing I can always find solutions to coding challenges 
            that may arise. I wanted to build something to showcase my capability of 
            creating real-life applications. This application will be used for Japan 
            Kauri Education Trust in Auckland.

        <h4>I studied Metalsmithing at Savannah College of Art and Design in Savannah,

            but with my freshly obtained web development skills, I can now save money 
            by creating my own website! For the template, I used HTML5UP and learned 
            how to integrate 3rd party code base into my own website. It gave me a 
            lot of great ideas for frontend development that I wouldn't have thought of. 
            This is a work in progress as I continuously think of creative and improving ideas to keep adding to the site.
