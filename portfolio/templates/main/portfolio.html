        <h4>Flask | HTML | CSS | Bootstrap</h4>
        <p>This application is made for <a href="http://jket.epizy.com/?i=1">Japan Kauri Education Trust </a>in Auckland, New Zealand 
            where they hold a few Japanese classes everyday. They were using a pen and 
            paper when parents drop-off/pick-up their children. One stone two birds. 
            I made this project for my Django capstone project and for JKET. 
            This simple application allows JKET admins and parents/guardians to have a central location to record 
            drop-offs/pick-ups as well as to check logs. Even more, they can save the cost of papers!
            The live version is up and running.</p>

        <h3>Remember Coco - Payment Tracking App</h3>
        <h4>Django | HTML | CSS | Bootstrap</h4>
        <p>This project was my long-lasting dream from the beginning of Django learning.
            This app helps my teenager daugther who is busy with part-time work, friends, and outing 
            at the same time who is forgetful to keep track of repayment. Mobile phone is her treasure.
            She can easily keep track of the history. </p>

        <h4>Flask | HTML | CSS | Bootstrap | HTML5UP</h4>
        <p>I studied Metalsmithing at Savannah College of Art and Design in Savannah, Georgia, USA back in 2002.
            I used to use wix.com for my jewllery website but with my freshly obtained web development knowledge, 
            I don't need to pay to use them anymore!
            For template, I used HTML5UP and learned how to integrate 3rd party code base into my own website.
            It gave me a lot of great idea for frontend development idea that I wouldn't think of.

            <h3>NZD-JPY Exchange Rate Alert</h3>
            <h4>Python3</h4>
            <p>Being from Japan and living in New Zealand, I need to keep an eye on currency exchange rate to transfer money.
                Being a mother of 3 children plus a dog, my day goes so fast and I can't keep thinking about checking today's rate.
                So I created this mini app. It uses crontab in my Ubuntu and sends me an email 
                when the currency rate goes below certain price, so that I can completely forget about even checking manually.

            <h4>Python3 | Selenium</h4>
            <p>While we were deciding how much we should be renting our rampus room downstairs, 
                I created this program that automatmatically collects certain conditions of rental property to 
                a separate Google Form and lists up in a csv file so that I can see the information at once.
                By changing the search filter, I can use it for different location, or instead for 
                purchasing property to find out average price range, the number of rooms and bathrooms.</p>
