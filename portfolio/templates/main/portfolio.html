        <h3>FreeStuff App</h3>
        <h4>Flask | HTML | CSS | Bootstrap</h4>
        <p>As a capstone project for Flask Web Development course in CodingNomads, I am very happy to say that 
            I integrated most of the topics I learned plus new packages, technologies, such as AWS S3 bucket, 
            SSL certificate, custom domain, search module etc. Thanks to all the struggle, I am now more confident
            that I can always find a solution somehow. I wanted to make something that shows my capability of creating 
            real-life application. This application will plan to be used for Japan Kauri Education Trus in Auckland.

        <h3>JKET Parent Registration App</h3>
        <h4>Django | HTML | CSS | Bootstrap</h4>
        <p>This application is made for <a href="http://jket.epizy.com/?i=1">Japan Kauri Education Trust </a>in Auckland, New Zealand 
            where they hold a few Japanese classes everyday. They were using a pen and 
            paper when parents drop-off/pick-up their children. One stone two birds. 
            I made this project as my Django capstone project and also for JKET. 
            This simple application allows JKET admins and parents/guardians to have a central location to record 
            drop-offs/pick-ups as well as to check logs. Even more, they can save the cost of papers!
            The live version is up and running.

        <h3>Remember Coco - Payment Tracking App</h3>
        <h4>Django | HTML | CSS | Bootstrap</h4>
        <p>This project was my long-lasting dream from the beginning of Django learning.
            I am hoping that this application helps my teenager daugther who is busy with part-time work, 
            friends, and outing at the same time who is forgetful to keep track of repayment. Mobile phone is her treasure.
            She can easily keep track of her owing histories.

        <h4>Flask | HTML | CSS | Bootstrap | HTML5UP</h4>
        <p>I studied Metalsmithing at Savannah College of Art and Design in Savannah, Georgia, USA back in 2002.
            I used to use wix.com for my jewllery website but with my freshly obtained web development knowledge, 
            I don't need to pay to use them anymore!
            For template, I used HTML5UP and learned how to integrate 3rd party code base into my own website.
            It gave me a lot of great idea for frontend development idea that I wouldn't think of.

            <h3>NZD-JPY Exchange Rate Alert</h3>
            <h4>Python3</h4>
            <p>Being from Japan and living in New Zealand, I need to keep an eye on currency exchange rate to transfer money.
                Being a mother of 3 children plus a dog, my day goes so fast and I can't keep thinking about checking today's rate.
                So I created this mini app. It uses crontab in my Ubuntu and sends me an email 
                when the currency rate goes below certain price, so that I can completely forget about checking the daily rate.

            <h4>Python3 | Selenium</h4>
            <p>While we were deciding how much we should be renting our rampus room downstairs, 
                I created this program that automatmatically collects certain conditions of rental property to 
                a separate Google Form and lists up in a csv file so that I can see the information at once.
                By changing the search filter, I can use it for different location, or instead for 
                purchasing property to find out average price range, the number of rooms and bathrooms.
